### ðŸ‘‹ Introduction:

---

Pavos Invoice is here to make invoicing simple, fast, and maybe even a little enjoyable. I built it to help freelancers, small businesses, and teams keep their billing organized without the headaches. From creating professional-looking invoices to tracking payments, everything is designed to be as smooth and intuitive as possible.

Powered by Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Prisma, Pavos Invoice is quick, responsive, and ready to grow with you. It includes dynamic templates, tax and discount calculations, and secure authentication so your data stays safe. Whether youâ€™re sending your first invoice or your hundredth, Pavos Invoice helps you stay focused on your workâ€”not the paperwork.
